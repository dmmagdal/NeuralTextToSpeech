# Audio Processing

Description: This folder doesn't have any models in it. It attempts to look at different ways to load and process audio data across different libraries such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, Librosa, and Scipy.


### Notes

 * Reading (wav) files
     * When reading a (wav) audio file, scipy loads data to a numpy array of dtype int16. Converting to float32 does not result in the numpy array matching the other numpy arrays from the other libraries (their defualt dtypes are float32). Converting the other numpy arrays to int16 would result in data loss (which isnt great).
     * In the Nvidia [Tacotron 2 repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) (the baseline), files are read with the scipy module and converted to float32. If we are to compare to that baseline, the numpy arrays generated by the other libraries will have to be convert to int16 before converting them back to float32 to have a realistic comparison.
         * Currently, even converting everything to int16 numpy arrays does not result in any matches the one generated by scipy.
 * Converting audio to Mel Spectrograms
